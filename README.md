 Python Based University Student Registration and Management System (Web App)

Develop a Student Registration System for a University. 
This should allow the students to view courses, register for courses, view their individual results (including GPA), 

Academics to view registered students for their courses, 

Management Staff to view registered students for each course, enter results for courses, view overall results of students, download result sheet and 

Admin to create accounts, reset passwords, add, or remove students from registered courses, assign academics for courses.

Once the marks for each semester have been entered, the GPA should be automatically calculated and updated.


If user forges his login details, user should contact the admin and ask to reset the password.


the username should be the registration number for students and name + surname for all other employees of the university.


when initially creating an account, just the username and password and an account type will be given by admin. The user when first login to the system needs fill his profile information such as contact no, email, index no, address into system.
